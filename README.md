# Data-Science-Course
This repository contains the Data science course assignments and projects that I worked on during the spring semester of 2025 in Shahid Beheshti University.
## Assignment 0
The purpose of this assignment is to help us understand the structure of a well-written report.
We are supposed to write an appropriate report based on the guide files that are provided by the TAs of this course for [this Kaggle nptebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/house-prices-prediction-using-tfdf?authuser=0#House-Prices-Prediction-using-TensorFlow-Decision-Forests)
## Assignment 1
 In this assignment, we will answer some questions about data using statistical tests and explore in dataset. in this assignment, we should focus on statistical tests more that EDA.
 ### 1 Amazon Sales Analysis
 [Amazon sales product dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CkdzTki8Ai4YIesgpYwyCNs-r7Nt8Zvs/view) contains product information, including pricing, dis-
counts, ratings, reviews, and user interactions. There are questions that are designed to analyze different aspects of the dataset using statistical methods.
### 2 Customer Personality Analysis
The goal of this exercise is to analyze a [customer personality dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis/data) containing demo-
graphic information, spending habits, promotional responses, and purchasing behaviors.
we will conduct hypothesis tests to uncover insights about customer behaviors and char-
acteristics.
## Assignment 2
In this assignment, the goal is to improve our real-world data skills through more emphasis on Exploratory Data Analysis. The purpose of this project is to develop
the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, apply statistical methods to real-world problems, and communicate our findings effectively
through visualization and storytelling.
### YouTube Videos Analysis
Here I explore the [YouTube trending videos dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new/) and uncover the key factors behind
viral content. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, I will analyze engagement patterns, trends, and content characteristics. However, this is not just about answering a set
of predefined questions. I craft my own data-driven story and develop meaningful insights
based on it.
## Assignment 3
In this assignment the main goal is to act as data-scientists for a fictitious data. Our mission is to
build a model that predicts a 11 class category from 64 synthesized flags. The features
mimic “present / absent” indicators such as abnormal lab values, symptoms, or billing
codes, making the task surprisingly subtle despite the modest table size.

There are three files on This [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/datascience-4-competition/overview):
train.csv contains 564 rows, each with an integer ID, 64 binary features (feature0 –
feature63) and the target label. test.csv mirrors that structure but omits the label,

holding 143 rows that will decide the leaderboard. sample submission.csv is a two-
column template (ID, label). Finally, y test.csv stores the hidden ground truth and is

visible only to Kaggle’s scoring engine. No feature is missing; every cell is either 0 or 1,
and the label is an integer 0–10, giving us eleven classes.
